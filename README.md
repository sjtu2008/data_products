This is an R project that created for the Developing Data Products Class of Coursera's Data Science Specialization.

The purpose of the project is to display the population no. of the cities in USA. The population data collected from us.cities which is the part of the R [maps](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/index.html) package I use the ggplot2 package to plot the map.

The objective of the assignment was to use the skills learnt in the class to create shiny application, which takes some form of user input and does somer server side calculation, and deploy it on Rstudio's shiny server. The server.R and ui.R files are the shiny application. The application has been deployed [here](https://itexpertsh.shinyapps.io/usa_populations/).

The second part of the assignment was to create a Reproducible Pitch Presentation for the app. This was to be a html5 slide deck using Rstudio Presenter. The files for the slidify presentation are in the Presenter folder and the presentation itself is hosted on RPub pages [here](https://rpubs.com/itexpertsh/184539).
