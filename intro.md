This is an R project that created for the Developing Data Products Class of Coursera's Data Science Specialization.

The purpose of the project is to display the population no. of the cities in USA. The population data collected from us.cities which is the part of the R [maps](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/index.html) package and I use the ggplot2 package to plot the map.
